## Working

Urban Air Check collects data from various environmental sensors placed across urban areas. These sensors continuously monitor air quality metrics such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The collected data is processed and analyzed in real-time, providing users with accurate and up-to-date information about the air quality in their vicinity. Users can access this information through a web interface or mobile application, allowing them to make informed decisions about outdoor activities, commuting routes, and health precautions.
